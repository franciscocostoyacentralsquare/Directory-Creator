Hello!

Thank you for using my program.

The directory creator will create new default folders
for new jurisdictions with the simple click of a button.

When used the program will create a directory in:
\JurisdictionFolders\Lake Mary Team\

It will create a new jurisdiction folder and up to 10 sub folders

WARNING!!
You must be connected to the \\psc-app03\ server. If your out of office,
make sure your connected via VPN before trying to make directories.
